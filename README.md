# cash-harvardCS50

This is the 2nd problem set of Harvard's CS50 course.

This program asks how much change is owed to you, and tells you the smallest amount of coins it takes to get said change.

For example, if you are owed $0.50, instead of giving you back a quarter, 2 dimes, and a nickel, the program gives you 2 quarters because it is the smallest amount of coins possible for what you are owed.
